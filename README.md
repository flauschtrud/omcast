# omcast

OmCast is a minimal YouTube playlist player with Chromecast functionality. It allows me to practice yoga with videos without being forced to have the native YouTube app installed on my phone. It is as well an exercise in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

The app uses the [android-youtube-player](https://github.com/PierfrancescoSoffritti/android-youtube-player) library to play YouTube content via the [IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) (and currently needs a local build of [my fork](https://github.com/flauschtrud/android-youtube-player) in order to work).
